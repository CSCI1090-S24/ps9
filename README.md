# Problem Set 9

You will be doing your work in a Colab notebook. 

1. Follow [this link to the Colab notebook for PS9](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pptHiifBKZmdsUuF-jgc2tWR5hV3X9co?usp=sharing). Then make your own copy, as described in the notebook.
2. You will edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
3. You will share the notebook with the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
4. You will download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you have done for previous problem sets.
5. You will *not* alter the Colab notebook after the deadline. If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late. When you put a copy in your GitHub repo, you'll ensure that the TAs will grade the right thing.

If you think you see an error or typo, let me know! I will update [this version of the repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-S24/ps9) with any corrections you suggest.

Don't forget that there is helpful code in [the sample code repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-S24/sample_code/). You'll need the sample code for week 10 and week 12.


**Remember** I now expect you to write comments in your code! One point will be deducted if you do not provide comments explaining your code. Here's what I would like commented this time:

* Before every variable *you* create, explain what value it is holding. Exception: variables that appear after the keyword `for`.
* **NEW** Insert a blank line before each comment. See my sample code for examples.
* **NEW** Insert line breaks in comments to make them readable without horizontal scrolling. See my sample code for examples.

**Remember** Now at the top of every file, you will include your honor pledge. I'll give you a space in the Colab notebook for you to write your pledge.

## Deliverables

This problem set is due **Saturday, April 20 at 11:59pm EDT**. Remember this is how you submit:

1. Share your Colab notebook with the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
2. Download the notebook to your computer, move it to this repository, and add, commit, and push it, just as you did for Python files in your previous problem sets.
